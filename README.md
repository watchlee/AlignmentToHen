# AlignmentToHen
Currently, the only thing I know is that tool is used to do alignment. Also, this project is my condition of graduate.


How to use?
==================

All program has same input foramt, and this input file is under the document, which name is same as program.

  For example, if you want to test Global alignment, you will use global.php and input file Global_2DR2-2J02/input.php.
You just need to execute php global.php ./Global_2DR2-2J02/, and it will automatically read input file, which is written into input.php, and compute the result into result.php.
